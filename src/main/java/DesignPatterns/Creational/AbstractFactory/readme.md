The **Abstract Factory** pattern is an extension of the Factory pattern. It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Instead of producing one type of product, the abstract factory creates a family of related products.

### Example Scenario

Imagine we have a furniture store that sells products for different styles: Modern and Victorian. Each style has its own types of furniture: a chair and a sofa. Using the Abstract Factory pattern, we can create furniture based on the style without specifying the exact types.

### Example Code

```java
// Step 1: Define abstract product interfaces
interface Chair {
    void sitOn();
}

interface Sofa {
    void layOn();
}

// Step 2: Implement concrete products for Modern style
class ModernChair implements Chair {
    @Override
    public void sitOn() {
        System.out.println("Sitting on a modern chair.");
    }
}

class ModernSofa implements Sofa {
    @Override
    public void layOn() {
        System.out.println("Laying on a modern sofa.");
    }
}

// Step 3: Implement concrete products for Victorian style
class VictorianChair implements Chair {
    @Override
    public void sitOn() {
        System.out.println("Sitting on a Victorian chair.");
    }
}

class VictorianSofa implements Sofa {
    @Override
    public void layOn() {
        System.out.println("Laying on a Victorian sofa.");
    }
}

// Step 4: Define the abstract factory interface
interface FurnitureFactory {
    Chair createChair();
    Sofa createSofa();
}

// Step 5: Implement concrete factories for each furniture style
class ModernFurnitureFactory implements FurnitureFactory {
    @Override
    public Chair createChair() {
        return new ModernChair();
    }

    @Override
    public Sofa createSofa() {
        return new ModernSofa();
    }
}

class VictorianFurnitureFactory implements FurnitureFactory {
    @Override
    public Chair createChair() {
        return new VictorianChair();
    }

    @Override
    public Sofa createSofa() {
        return new VictorianSofa();
    }
}

// Step 6: Client code that uses the abstract factory
public class AbstractFactoryPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a Modern furniture factory
        FurnitureFactory modernFactory = new ModernFurnitureFactory();
        Chair modernChair = modernFactory.createChair();
        Sofa modernSofa = modernFactory.createSofa();
        
        // Using the Modern furniture
        modernChair.sitOn();
        modernSofa.layOn();

        // Creating a Victorian furniture factory
        FurnitureFactory victorianFactory = new VictorianFurnitureFactory();
        Chair victorianChair = victorianFactory.createChair();
        Sofa victorianSofa = victorianFactory.createSofa();
        
        // Using the Victorian furniture
        victorianChair.sitOn();
        victorianSofa.layOn();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Abstract Product Interfaces (`Chair`, `Sofa`)**:
    - These interfaces define common operations (`sitOn()` for `Chair`, `layOn()` for `Sofa`) that concrete product classes will implement.

2. **Concrete Product Classes**:
    - `ModernChair`, `ModernSofa` for modern furniture style.
    - `VictorianChair`, `VictorianSofa` for Victorian furniture style.
    - Each class implements its respective interface to provide specific behavior.

3. **Abstract Factory Interface (`FurnitureFactory`)**:
    - Declares the methods `createChair()` and `createSofa()` for creating different types of furniture.

4. **Concrete Factory Classes**:
    - `ModernFurnitureFactory` and `VictorianFurnitureFactory` implement the `FurnitureFactory` interface to create instances of `Modern` and `Victorian` furniture, respectively.

5. **Client Code**:
    - The client code (`AbstractFactoryPatternExample`) uses `FurnitureFactory` to get a specific style of furniture (`Modern` or `Victorian`) without depending on specific classes.
    - The client only interacts with the `FurnitureFactory` interface, making it easy to switch styles or add new styles.

### Output

```plaintext
Sitting on a modern chair.
Laying on a modern sofa.
Sitting on a Victorian chair.
Laying on a Victorian sofa.
```

### Benefits of the Abstract Factory Pattern

1. **Consistency among Related Objects**: Ensures that objects created from the same factory are compatible with each other (e.g., all modern furniture).
2. **Flexibility and Scalability**: New families of products (e.g., `ArtDecoFurnitureFactory`) can be added with minimal changes to the client code.
3. **Encapsulation of Product Creation**: The client code is decoupled from the concrete implementations of products, relying only on the abstract factories and interfaces.

The Abstract Factory pattern is commonly used in GUI toolkits, frameworks that support multiple themes, and any scenario where families of related objects need to be created based on context.
